# fastify-typescript-extended-sample

âš  Work In Progress

This project is supposed to be a large, fake Fastify &amp; TypeScript app. It is meant to be a reference as well as a pseudo-sandbox for Fastify TypeScript changes.

Contributions are always welcome!

> Disclaimer:
> This repo is not the **only** way to build a Fastify App. It is just _one_ way to do so that plays nicely with TypeScript.

Based heavily off of [covid-green-backend-api](https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-backend-api) Nearform project.
